# Sequential Calculator - Overview

This is a project I created while doing The Odin Project's foundations course.

It features a sequential operating calculator, that performs the basic arithmetic operations on recent inputs. By recent inputs, it means that the calculator does not follow BODMAS/PEMDAS rule, because output of previous operation becomes one of the inputs for next operations.

For example, equations like `2 x 2 + 3 x 3` will result in `21` instead of `13`; this way of calculating was instructed in the course itself.

# Challenges Faced

This was one of the hardest projects for me, and I spent months upon this to improve my fundamentals in Vanilla JS and CSS Flexbox
- Understanding and applying the knowledge of all the changes that happen on every next click, due to the nature of this type of calculator
- Prevent edge cases bugs that happens due to user providing an unexpected input
- Navigate through [the constraints](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator#assignment) provided by The Odin Project.
