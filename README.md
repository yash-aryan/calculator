# calculator

This is a project I created while doing The Odin Project's foundations course.

It features a sequential operating calculator, that performs the basic arithmetic operations on recent inputs. By recent inputs, it means that the calculator does not follow BODMAS/PEMDAS rule, because output of previous operation becomes one of the inputs for next operations.

For example, equations like `2*2 + 3*3` will result in `21` instead of `13`; this way of calculating was instructed in the course itself.
